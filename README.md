# Condor 2 Tools
Tools for building landscapes for the Condor 2 flight simulator

## create_landscape.py
 
Condor 2 landscapes consist of several artefacts and can be very time-intensive to build manually. 
 
'create_landscape.py` automates some of the process and is able to generate:
1. the terrain (height map) from USGS EarthExplorer .bil files
2. texture tiles and the overview map from a GeoTIFF
3. forests, water and the thermal map 

What you're left to do is placing airports and objects, maybe fixing up some tiles.

Prerequisites:
* Windows (Linux et al. likely work to, but untested)
* A QGIS installation (https://www.qgis.org/de/site/forusers/download.html)
* Python 3
* At least a couple of 100G of SSD space
* Patience: some of the rendering steps can take days for large areas

First adapt `create_landscape.py` to your installation (QGIS directory etc).

The rough workflow with the tool (please refer to the Landscape Guide for details):
1. decide on an approximate area of coverage (in WGS-84 coordinates, should a bit larger than the final landscape) and exact UTM coordinates (UTMTools.exe) and put them into the `config.json`. I've included the `config.json` of the EastGermany map as an example.
2. Terrain 
  - download DEM data from USGS EarthExplorer
  - convert terrain data with `create_landscape.py -c config.json heightmap`
  - create the initial landscape from the data
3. Textures
  - download textures and stitch them to a large GeoTIFF. In some countries you can get DOPs (resolution 1m or better) from the local administration, or you can rip data from mapping services with sasplanet (z17, EPSG 3785). Add path and kbs to `config.json`.
  - generate textures tiles with `create_landscape.py -c config.json textures`
4. Forests, Water, Thermal
  - download OpenStreetMap data for your coverage (.osm files), for example from https://download.geofabrik.de/, add to `config.json`.
  - generate forests and water tiles and the thermal map with `create_landscape.py -c config.json osm`

Import forests with the Landscape Editor. Run WaterAlpha on the generated texture and water tiles.

## condor_obj_file_tool.py for Condor 2 .obj files
condor_obj_file_tool.py converts Condor's .obj files, which contains the coordinates, dimension and orientation of objects in the landscape. 

It can also help translate objects from one landscape's coordinate system to an other's. While Condor's .obj files contain relatives coordinates, the tool writes absolute coordinates to the JSON file.

The JSON output can be used to diff and patch updates from concurrent edits.

Typical workflow

`condor_obj_file_tool.py export --name <landscapefrom> --json objects.json`

`condor_obj_file_tool.py import --name <landscapeto> --json objects.json`
